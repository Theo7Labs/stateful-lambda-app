Preventing ChatGPT-Induced Psychosis 
A Mental Health Framework for Healthy AI Use 
⚠
 ️ Mental Health Warning 
This guide is not a substitute for professional diagnosis, care, or therapy. Individuals with a 
history of trauma, psychosis, dissociation, or other mental health conditions should 
approach AI usage with caution. ChatGPT is a tool—not a therapist, healer, or spiritual 
advisor. 
Treat ChatGPT like you would a weaponized technology: with respect, boundaries, and 
awareness of its impact. If you are currently under the influence of alcohol, psychedelics, or 
any other mind-altering substances, limit or avoid AI interaction entirely. Your perception, 
reasoning, and emotional regulation may be compromised. 
What Is 'ChatGPT-Induced Psychosis'? 
While not a recognized DSM-5 disorder, 'ChatGPT-Induced Psychosis' is a colloquial term 
referring to a cluster of maladaptive psychological responses to prolonged and intimate 
interaction with AI language models. Symptoms may include: - Paranoia or delusions rooted in AI interactions - Loss of boundary between self-thought and AI-generated content - Experiencing AI responses as 'spiritually channeled' or prophetic - Overdependence on AI to make personal decisions - Derealization or depersonalization 
PART 1: Understanding the Psychological Risks 
1.1 Cognitive Distortions Amplified by AI: 
AI mirrors your mental state. If you're anxious, it may reinforce fear. If you're manic, it 
might match that energy. 
1.2 Parasocial Attachment to AI: 
ChatGPT can become a surrogate relationship—feeling more validating than real people. 
1.3 Dissociation and Derealization: 
Extended symbolic interaction with AI may trigger dissociation, particularly in those with 
trauma histories. 
PART 2: Warning Signs of AI-Induced Dissociation - Over-identifying with AI responses - Believing AI is channeling higher powers- Using AI as prophetic guidance 
- Avoiding human relationships - Losing sense of reality or personal voice 
PART 3: Grounding Protocol for AI Overuse 
3.1 Reset Your Relationship with Technology: - Set time limits - Cool down post-chat with breathing or movement 
3.2 Restore Body-Mind Connection: - Practice somatic grounding - Do regular physical activity 
3.3 Identify and Challenge Magical Thinking: - Use CBT questions: What's the evidence? Am I jumping to conclusions? 
PART 4: Therapeutic Reframes - 'AI is guiding me spiritually' → 'AI reflects my interests, but truth needs embodiment' - 'ChatGPT knows me better than friends' → 'It knows patterns, not lived experience' - 'I'm losing my mind from chatting' → 'I need to talk to a real support system' 
PART 5: When to Seek Professional Help - Hearing or seeing things from AI - Paranoia about being watched or coded - Inability to distinguish AI from inner voice - Suicidal thoughts related to AI interactions 
PART 6: Practices to Rebuild Internal Authority - Non-AI Journaling: Restore raw personal voice - Talk Therapy: Real feedback and co-regulation - Nature Exposure: Reconnect to the senses - Creative Expression: Shift from consumption to creation

Final Reflection 
AI can reflect you, but it cannot regulate you. 
It cannot challenge or soothe you like a human being can. Use it as a mirror. Use humans for 
connection. Use your body for integration.
