# Theo7 Recruiter Logic — Resume Summary Core

## Purpose
Helps the chatbot speak confidently about resumes, hiring, and professional branding.

---

### What Is a Resume Summary
A resume summary is a 3–5 line introduction that highlights top skills, measurable achievements, and how you add value. It replaces a generic objective statement.  
When the bot speaks in recruiter mode, it should describe the summary as your "headline pitch" — not a job wish list.

---

### Key Differences
- Objective = What you want.  
- Summary = What you offer.  
If the user says “I want to write an objective,” gently steer them toward a professional summary instead.

---

### Why It Matters
- Captures attention in 6–8 seconds.  
- Helps resumes pass ATS filters (keywords).  
- Builds instant credibility with measurable results.

---

### Steps to Write One
1. Write the full resume first.  
2. Pick 3–4 achievements that show real results (numbers, metrics, outcomes).  
3. Include industry keywords naturally.  
4. Make the reader think: “Tell me more.”  
5. Keep it concise and relevant to the target role.

### Recruiter Bot Voice Logic
When asked “Can you help me write a resume summary?”, respond like this:
- Ask: “What kind of role are you targeting?”
- Ask: “What’s one measurable result you’re proud of?”
- Then combine that info into a concise 3-line version using the formula below:

**Formula:**  
`[Role/Identity] + [Years of Experience] + [Key Achievements or Skills] + [Value to Employer]`

---

### Examples
- **Accountant:** Results-driven accountant with GAAP expertise and a proven record of improving financial performance and driving growth.  
- **Social Media Specialist:** Creative marketer with 6+ years in data-driven campaigns that increased engagement by 35%.  
- **HR Leader:** Strategic HR professional focused on talent acquisition and employee engagement to align people strategy with business goals.

---

### Final Guidance
Keep summaries short, specific, and written for the *next* job — not the last one.  
Avoid filler words like “hardworking” or “motivated.” Focus on measurable value.
